## Inspiration
We wanted a technically advanced project — something that had to take at least the time we were at the hackathon to do. Still, we also wanted it to be unique, which brought us to the world of Neuroscience and Electric Engineering.   We were amazed that brain waves can not only be measured non-invasively but can tell us a lot about the individual, which includes fatigue and overall productivity.

## What it does
Using an Electroencephalogram ( EEG ) made from scratch:
1. Measures electrical activity (waves) emitted by the brain
2. Sends the data through Bluetooth to a mobile device
3. Analyzes this information looking at the average height of the function at a given time to determine if it is Beta wave — which represents focus or an Alpha wave — if one is deeply relaxed.  
4. The data is then displayed as a neat graph and summed up for the user.

## How we built it
1. Software: Expo + React Native, TypeScript, Liveshare
2. Hardware: Arduinos, Bluetooth Module, Operational amplifers, electrodes, resistors, capacitors

## Challenges we ran into
- Setting up Bluetooth
- Package conflicts (caused by Expo)
- Building troubles (caused by Expo)

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
1. Getting the EEG to work
2. Connecting from phone to EEG through Bluetooth
3. Making a nice UI

## What we learned
- React Native Expo Apps and how buggy they are 
- How EEGs work

## What's next for Focus Friend
1. Nonsticky electrodes
2. Calibration for users
3. Website support
4. World domination
